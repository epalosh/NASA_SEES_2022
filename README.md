# README: SEES-2022

Welcome to my repository of personal contributions during my NASA internship! Me and my project group were granted access to satelite data through Google Earth Engine, and had the opportunity to analyze raw data from a variety of remote sensing satellites. The notebooks in this repository access, stratify, and map this data into useful plots we used for analysis in a final presentation to NASA scientists, engineers, and subject matter experts.
